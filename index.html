            <p>Hi, my name is Israel Wangila, and I was born the 20th of June, 1992. I'm from Nairobi Kenya. I have graduated from the Moringa School of Computer Science degree in  computer science with a GPA of 8.9/10. The course I took was Information Technology. Since March 2020 I have been studying programming, via Internet. I think I have tried every possible way of learning, as in, watching many hours of video tutorials, learning through websites like freeCodeCamp, Codecademy, and many others. I also finished two courses, eSova (JavaScript) and Clever (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript). The last couple of months I've mostly been reading e-books about programming. As a result, I now have enough knowledge to make programs using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, C#, T-SQL, ASP.NET MVC, Git. I'm currently looking to get a job as a junior programmer using the skills I already possess. I'm a workaholic and I see myself as a future programmer. I love creating stuff with code, it's like having superpowers in real life, and yes, in my younger years I read many comics.</p>
